## Insider trading

Insider trading involves trading in a public company's stock or other securities by someone with non-public, material information about the company.
Insider transactions are legal if the insider makes a trade and reports it to the Securities and Exchange Commission.


### Instructions
The idea is to create a process that that will extract the data and analyse it to report inside trading.

The criteria to select the companies is up to you! You can find a list of public tickers in the links below.

The expected response will be the ticker/company, the person who did the transaction, job title, the date and the amount of shares and how much in percentage of the market cap that represents. 

*bonus*: unit tests and documentation
