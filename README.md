## Insider trading

Insider trading involves trading in a public company's stock or other securities by someone with non-public, material information about the company.
Insider transactions are legal if the insider makes a trade and reports it to the Securities and Exchange Commission.


### Instructions
The idea is to create a process that that will extract the data and analyse it to report inside trading.

We need to analyse the data of 3 companies. The criteria to select the companies is up to you! You can find a list of public tickers in the links below.

*bonus*: unit tests and documentation
